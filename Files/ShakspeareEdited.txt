My Mistress' Eyes Are Nothing Like The Sun,
Coral Is Far More Red, Than Her Lips Red,
If Snow Be White, Why Then Her Breasts Are Dun:
If Hairs Be Wires, Black Wires Grow On Her Head:
I Have Seen Roses Damasked, Red And White,
But No Such Roses See I In Her Cheeks,
And In Some Perfumes Is There More Delight,
Than In The Breath That From My Mistress Reeks.
I Love To Hear Her Speak, Yet Well I Know,
That Music Hath A Far More Pleasing Sound:
I Grant I Never Saw A Goddess Go,
My Mistress When She Walks Treads On The Ground.
And Yet By Heaven I Think My Love As Rare,
As Any She Belied With False Compare.
